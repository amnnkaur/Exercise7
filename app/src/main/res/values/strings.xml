        Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. \n
        It is used by several smartphones and tablets. \n
        Examples include the Sony Xperia, the Samsung Galaxy, and the Google Nexus One.\n
        The Android operating system (OS) is based on the Linux kernel.\n
        Unlike Apple's iOS, Android is open source, meaning developers can modify and customize the OS for each phone.\n
        Therefore, different Android-based phones often have different graphical user interfaces GUIs even though they use the same OS.\n
